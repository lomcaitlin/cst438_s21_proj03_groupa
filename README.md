# Wired Gamble
## Goal of the project
- this is basically the description from the proposal
## Team
- I want real names and github user names
- It is also a good idea to include links to your individual github profiles.

## Minimum Viable Product
- This should tie in with the goal. If the goal is to offer social media for cats (Clowder Connector), than it would be something like 'create a profile and share stories'

## Timeline for completion with goals
- These goals should relate to the user stories that you have on your project board
- The timeline should be updated as the project progresses
## Mockups and ERDs
- These may need to be improved from the proposal
- I also want these to be kept CURRENT that means if the database structure changes, the ERDs will need to change.
## Technologies
- link to them
- We are using Android so a link to that is a bare minimum
- Include any and all APIs you are using
